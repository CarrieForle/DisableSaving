# DisableSaving

## Important

I made this mod to ease mod developement so no changes are made to 
saves. I could not guarantee this mod don't break or work with other 
mods. Proceed with caution.

A Silksong mod that adds an option to disable saving progress which 
can be accessed from BepinEx config manager by 
pressing F1.

This has a side effect of dying in Steel Soul doesn't lose your save file.
